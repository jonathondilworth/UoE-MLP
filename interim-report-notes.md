###Â Interim Report Notes

**Research Questions:**

Two research questions that will be answered within the interim report.

* How do similarity differences between datasets affect the performance (generalisation, accuracy, error) of fairly simple convolutional neural network architectures?
* How does reducing the size of a dataset affect the performance of fairly simple convolutional neural network architectures?

In addition, we are also obtaining benchmarks for large datasets on fairly simple convolutional neural network architectures using large datasets during the interim period.

**Next Steps:**

* Apply techniques such as deep feature extraction and transfer learning (we could try transferring from ImageNet, perhaps?)
