## Comments on MLP task (2/2/18)

#### Comments on initial Ideas:

* The preprocessing methods employed by the Chen et al. paper are fairly comprehensive.
* So we’d be looking at using the same dataset, training a conventional architecture of some kind, and then comparing their manual feature extraction to the ‘automatic’ (for lack of a better word) feature extraction performed by the network architecture?
* To re-iterate what has already been said: I would have though the dataset is probably a little small. <- this is essentially going to be our problem domain, right?
* It would be really cool if we could have some kind of generative model produce the data for us (I think this was mentioned by our tutor on Monday?), but I’m really not very well read on the literature surrounding that particular domain (although, I wouldn’t mind familiarising myself with it) - I know it’s supposed to be difficult stuff - so it may be infeasible within the timeframe we’ve got?

#### Further comments:

* Great work on setting up the Google doc and moving forwards.
* I really like the proposed problem domain. Although, I'll probably have some questions to ask about it today.
* What sort of architectures do you think are appropriate for obtaining a baseline, or multiple baselines? Is this something that should be discussed, or has this already been established?
* I’ll start reviewing the literature associated with our problem domain this weekend.
* Any additional suggested readings would be much appreciated, the information Sebastian linked was very helpful.
* Perhaps we should start taking minutes within meetings, or is this too formal?
