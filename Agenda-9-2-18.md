###Â Agenda for MLP Meeting 9-2-18

* Discuss the merits of using an alternative dataset as proposed by Steve.
* Discuss the experimental results provided by Sebastian.
* Figure out when exactly our next tutorial is.
* Transfer all MarkDown notes in our github repo over to the google doc visible by our tutor + S. Renals.
* See how our interim report renders in LaTeX (as it's currently written in MarkDown) in order to gauge how much more work these is to do to fill ~6 pages.
* Think about how we're going to move forwards.
* Discuss the processing methods that have been applied to our datasets, so we can integrate this into the interim report.

**Action Points:**

* Sebastian: Clean new DB, create scripts for experiments, send us scripts and we'll run experiments.
* Jonathon: Continue writing the report - 1. Introduction, 2. Research Questions and 3. Run experiments that Sebastian has linked.
* Steve: Look at writing 4. Methodology. Run Experiments that Sebastian has linked.
