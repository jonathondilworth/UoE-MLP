###Â Agenda for MLP Meeting 9-2-18

* Discuss the merits of using an alternative dataset as proposed by Steve.
* Discuss the experimental results provided by Sebastian.
* Figure out when exactly our next tutorial is.
* Transfer all MarkDown notes in our github repo over to the google doc visible by our tutor + S. Renals.
* See how our interim report renders in LaTeX (as it's currently written in MarkDown) in order to gauge how much more work these is to do to fill ~6 pages.
* Think about how we're going to move forwards.
