### Meeting Minutes (5/2/18)

**Discussed New Approach:**

* Considering using 2 datasets: clothes dataset with obvious differences between samples, faces dataset with subtle difference between samples.
* Train 3-layer CNN on both sets and compare accuracies.
* Take subsamples of the original dataset to train the same network and compare the accuracies (performance).

**Action Points in anticipation for Wednesday:**

* Sebastian: Start cleaning the data in anticipation for Wednesday.
* Jonathon: Start formalising the report (see structure on MLP, CW3 PDF)
* Steve: Start reading into techniques for small data (deep feature extraction and transfer learning).
